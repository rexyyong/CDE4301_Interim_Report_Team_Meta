        <h2> 1. Introduction (Maia & Jonathan) </h2>
        <p>
          The NUS-Stanford Global Engineering Design Innovation Programme is a collaborative effort between the 2
          universities, where project teams, together with an industry partner, work to solve a problem provided by
          the industry partner. The prompt assigned to us is as follows: This project explores how smart glasses,
          sensors, and AI can augment and enrich social interactions. Students should consider diverse user groups to
          uncover unmet needs, then propose solutions that address those needs through the design of the user
          experience and hardware/software capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team, under the guidance of our professor and advisor, Professor Khoo Eng Tat and Graham Zhu, started by
          exploring many potential user groups. We then delved deeper into a select few with the most potential to
          work on. Initial groups we explored included the visually-impaired, hearing-impaired and networking
          professionals. After weeks of research and deliberation, we have decided to focus our efforts on the topic
          of elderly loneliness, an increasingly prevalent problem around the world and in Singapore.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, the World Health Organisation declared loneliness a global public health concern [1]. Around the
          world, countries have created task forces to tackle this issue specifically [2]. Japan and the United
          Kingdom have established a new role called the Minister for Loneliness, which highlights the increased focus
          that these countries are putting on addressing it [2]. In Singapore, about an average of 50% or more people
          feel socially isolated and coupled with the ageing population, it puts a strain on our community to reach
          out to the elderly and keep them engaged [3]. The truth of the matter is: the silver tsunami is
          increasingly enveloping our populations and exacerbating this problem in the elderly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 14.1% of the elderly above 70 live with a mental disorder, with one of the causes being social
          isolation, with a staggering suicide rate of 16.6% [4]. They also experience health consequences such as
          increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, this project aims to create a new system using extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence
          (AI) to bridge the gap faced by the elderly when building and maintaining social interactions.

        <h3>2.1. Literature Review</h3>
        <p>
          Social Isolation vs Loneliness
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Puyane et al, social isolation refers to an objective lack of social contact, while loneliness
          is the subjective experience of unmet social needs [5]. A study identified key factors contributing to
          elderly loneliness, such as: being old, a widow/divorced, having a lower level of education and/or income,
          living alone, having a chronic disease, poor self-perceived health, lack of visits by relatives or
          acquaintances, dissatisfaction with the place of living, and being fully dependent while performing daily
          activities [6].
        </p>
        <p>
          What can be done to combat this? It turns out that having more frequent, more pleasant and in-person social
          interactions, as well as interactions with friends and family specifically, significantly predicted lower
          momentary loneliness a few hours later [7]. Additionally, home-based interventions were found to
          significantly increase older adults’ social connectedness (social support and social engagement) and reduce
          their loneliness and depressive symptoms; and interventions using mixed platforms were more favourable,
          which include face-to-face and digital delivery [8].
        </p>
        <p>
          Active ageing, Befriending, and Care and support in the Community model (ABC)
        </p>
        <image-component tag="fig-1" source="assets/figure/f1.png" subtitle="Figure 1: ABC Model"></image-component>
        <p>
          Singapore's strategy to combat social isolation employs the 'ABC' framework, which differentiates its
          approach across a continuum of need: <strong>Active Ageing</strong> functions as the primary
          <strong>preventive strategy</strong> for all older adults, promoting participation in social, cultural,
          spiritual, and civic affairs to maintain overall health and quality of life, thereby stemming the initial
          onset of isolation [9]. In contrast, <strong>Befriending</strong> is a <strong>targeted
            intervention</strong> focusing on older people already identified as socially isolated, creating a
          "<strong>purpose-built, one-on-one relationship</strong>" to provide direct companionship and fill the social
          gap for those who lack a personal network [10], [11]. Finally, the <strong>Community</strong> pillar,
          facilitated by groups such as Resident Networks and the People's Association, offers accessible programs,
          such as fitness classes and arts and crafts sessions, that serve as supported group-based environments to
          foster new social connections and encourage active engagement among seniors in their neighbourhood [12].
        </p>
        <p>
          Befriender Model Overview
        </p>
        <p>
          As Singapore's traditional family structures evolve and fewer relatives live together, the societal need for
          companionship services has grown, prompting social service agencies to complement their core programmes
          with befriending [13], [14]. This service targets older adults who exhibit at least one of the four risk
          factors: living alone, physical or cognitive impairment, limited social networks, or serving as a primary
          caregiver. These factors reduce the daily social contact and emotional support that the individuals need.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) defines a befriender primarily as a companion who provides
          sustained emotional support and cultivates meaningful social bonds. Through regular home visits and
          conversations, befrienders work to reduce loneliness and encourage seniors to participate in activities
          outside the home [14].
        </p>
        <p>
          Gap in the Current Model
        </p>
        <image-component tag="fig-2" source="assets/figure/f2.png"
          subtitle="Figure 2: Gaps in the Befriending model"></image-component>
        <p>
          Current befriending services face a twofold crisis in logistics and design. Agencies struggle to recruit and
          retain volunteers for long-term commitments because the model requires frequent visits, such as twice
          weekly over six months or longer, and few people can sustain this level of involvement [15]. Turnover
          matters because isolated seniors need time and a steady presence to build trust, and for many, consistency
          is not a preference but a source of personal security. Knowing that someone will reliably visit or call
          creates perceived dependability, which is important for befriending to be successful [16].
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these operational challenges, research on the befriending model often shows weak and inconsistent
          long-term effectiveness [17]. This failure stems from a disconnect between the service's design and what
          seniors actually value [17].
        </p>
        <p>
          Practitioners report that the loneliest seniors do not want a random visitor; they want a genuine
          connection with peers who share similar backgrounds and life experiences [13]. Research shows that
          effective befriending does not happen by chance and depends on activating specific mechanisms that current
          models often ignore [17]. The mechanisms include empathy, reciprocity and autonomy. Shared experience
          generates empathy, for example, when a befriender and a senior both live with arthritis. Shared
          characteristics foster reciprocity, enabling volunteers and users to form mutual two-way relationships.
          Long-term flexible relationships support autonomy, while rigid, predefined priorities do not. To be
          effective, programmes must therefore prioritise deliberate matching and sustained relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the current befriending model fails because it is built on a "buddy" system of random,
          high-turnover volunteers, while the loneliest seniors need consistent, peer-to-peer connections to feel
          secure and understood.

        <h3>2.2. Survey Data</h3>
        <p>
          We started our journey by interviewing diverse stakeholders, including academics, social workers, startup
          founders and community organisers from the People’s Association and Active Ageing Centres to gain a deeper
          understanding of social isolation. We also gathered direct user insights from the elderly through a card
          sorting activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the insights tabulated in <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJAMZw-E=/">Miro</a>, we identified
          categories of needs that could be broadly classified under social interactions, successful interactions,
          autonomy, training and support for workers, cognitive stimulation, and cultural stigma. From these

        <image-component tag="fig-5" source="assets/figure/f5.png" subtitle="Figure 5: Two-pronged Approach"></image-component>
        <p>
          Drawing on our primary and secondary research, we adopt a two-pronged approach to address elderly
          loneliness. First, we support older adults in leading more connected lives through technology and human
          networks. Given persistent manpower shortages, the current befriender model cannot reliably deliver
          sustained companionship; technology can complement it and reduce reliance on volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we empower social workers to deliver more timely, personalised support. Heavy caseloads and
          administrative burden constrain service quality. Hence, by streamlining workflows and providing decision
          support, social workers can devote more time to high-value interactions that help seniors reconnect with
          the community.

          In this section, we will explore the concepts related to the elderly (above age 65) that can address the
          gaps identified in the previous section.

        <h3>3.1. Problem Statement for the Elderly</h3>
        <p>
          Socially isolated elderly in Singapore need reliable, long-term companionship to reduce loneliness and
          preserve their overall well-being. Existing befriending models fail to deliver sustained, well-matched
          relationships due to volunteer shortages and the short-term matching of random volunteers who do not meet
          the needs of the elderly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-3-2-elderly-needs">
        <h3>3.2. Elderly Needs</h3>
        <p>
          To address the problem statement, the solution must address the following elderly needs:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Elderly users need a non-judgmental space where they can express views and emotions without criticism or
            stigma. </li>
          <li>Elderly users need companionship access that is consistently available when they reach out. </li>
          <li>Elderly users need an interaction channel that is accessible and intuitive for low digital-literacy
            users and those with sensory or motor limitations.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div id="section-3-3-case-studies-on-ai-companions">
        <h3>3.3. Case Studies on AI Companions</h3>
        <p>
          A two-week ChatGPT intervention with 20 older adults reduced the proportion scoring above the UCLA
          loneliness threshold of 43, a high degree of loneliness, from 100% to 32%. Participants attributed this
          change to the system’s constant availability and perceived dependability, noting that <strong>“ChatGPT is
            always there to chat with me, no matter the time or day.”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          They valued the AI’s ability to hold context-rich conversations across social, recreational and
          informational topics, saying <strong>“I liked that ChatGPT could talk about a lot of different things, from
            the weather to my favourite TV shows,”</strong> and they described most interactions as social,
          recreational, educational or emotional in nature [18].
        </p>
        <p>
          Users also highlighted practical benefits, including instant information retrieval, calendar management and
          medication reminders, and they said the AI’s patient, non-judgmental responses encouraged disclosure and
          emotional sharing. Several participants called the system a confidant, reporting that <strong>“it
            understands me in ways that no one else can,”</strong> and many summed up the experience with,
          <strong>“It’s comforting to know that there is someone who listens and understands, even if it’s an
            AI.”</strong> Together, these findings show that consistent availability, empathetic tone, contextual
          knowledge and being an easy information source combine to produce meaningful companionship and measurable
          reductions in loneliness [18].
        </p>
        <p>
          A six-month pilot of an Alexa AI assistant with 105 homebound older adults produced a mean reduction of
          10.87 points on the UCLA Loneliness Scale, offering a real-world benchmark for medium-term impact [19]. The
          device functioned as a companion, facilitating communication with family and friends and providing
          practical support such as medication and appointment reminders, suggesting that conversational presence
          combined with task assistance can improve both social connectedness and day-to-day functioning [19].
        </p>
        <p>
          With the research being positive on the use of chatbots to alleviate the perception of loneliness the next
          promising direction include prioritising low-friction delivery, such as TV and natural speech or gesture
          interfaces to maximise uptake, leveraging AI’s always-on availability to provide consistent perceived
          dependability that builds trust, and using proactive but tunable nudges to increase engagement while
          monitoring intrusion [20],[21].
        </p>
        <p>
          This gap creates a clear design space for alternative solutions that reliably deliver consistent,
          judgment-free social contact that the elderly can relate to, which could potentially nudge them to carry
          out activities that reduce social isolation.

        <h3>3.4. Development of Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          From the previous section, conversational AI can help alleviate loneliness among older adults. When paired
          with the hands-free interface of AR glasses, this approach can significantly reduce the friction in user
          interaction. Building on this idea, we propose two concepts designed to address the companionship gap faced
          by socially isolated elderly individuals.
        </p>

          subtitle="Figure 6: A visual illustration of Befriender at Your Service (Generated using Gemini)"></image-component>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Befriender at Your Service:</strong> This concept envisions AR glasses equipped with a familiar
            avatar and a conversational AI tailored to the needs of older adults. The system sustains companionship
            by proactively initiating check-ins, recalling past conversations and personal preferences. The AI will
            employ non-judgmental, validation-oriented language to ensure users feel heard and respected. Its
            always-on availability and predictable interaction cadence offer a stable alternative to volunteer
            befrienders, helping mitigate the inconsistencies of current models. The interface prioritises
            accessibility through hands-free, low-friction controls, making it suitable for users with limited
            technological familiarity or physical impairments. </li>
        </ol>
        <image-component tag="fig-7" source="assets/figure/f7.png"
          subtitle="Figure 7: A visual illustration of Connecting You (Generated using Gemini)"></image-component>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong>Connecting You:</strong> This concept features an AR heads-up display that highlights a curated
            list of close contacts, alongside real-time availability indicators. Users can initiate a voice or video
            call with a single spoken command, reducing the uncertainty and hesitation associated with interrupting
            others. By removing technical barriers, such as navigating apps or contact lists, the system streamlines
            the connection process. Additionally, the interface will show nearby social activities aligned with the
            user’s interests, along with one-command RSVP and navigation functions. This reduces cognitive load and
            bridges the gap between event discovery and participation, promoting more frequent and meaningful social
            engagement.</li>

        <h3>3.5. Critical Function Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          To evaluate the effectiveness of our concepts, we conducted critical function prototyping for both ideas.
          For Befriender at Your Service, we tested whether a conversational AI could sustain natural and engaging
          dialogue with elderly users. For Connecting You, we assessed whether real-time visibility of loved ones’
          availability would encourage more frequent user-initiated contact.
        </p>

          subtitle="Figure 8: Testing of AI Companion with an Elderly"></image-component>
        <p>
          We tested three conversational AI models—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—with elderly participants using an iPad
          interface. Each session lasted 1 hour, with each model being tested for 20 minutes, during which we
          recorded the following metrics:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Number of conversation interruptions/drop-offs </li>
          <li>Number of misunderstandings by AI/user during the conversation </li>
          <li>Ratio of AI-to-user speaking time </li>
          <li>Number of times the user laughed/smiled (used as a proxy for engagement and enjoyment)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To ensure consistency of the experiment, we prompted the AI based on what makes a good befriender: “You are
          a compassionate befriender speaking with an older adult in Singapore. Listen, validate, and keep the
          conversation going. Speak at a moderate pace. Use simple, open-ended questions and let the person finish
          before you respond. Be empathetic and match their pace and vocabulary. Ask gentle follow-up questions that
          invite storytelling, and encourage softly if they hesitate. Avoid judging, lecturing, or arguing. If they
          mention harm, severe distress, or a medical emergency, escalate to a human contact. Keep replies brief and
          wait for their response.”\[22].

        <h4>3.5.2. Connecting You</h4>
        <p>
          To evaluate the effectiveness of displaying loved ones’ availability, we conducted a two-day experiment
          with an elderly participant. On Day 1, we recorded the baseline number of calls made. On Day 2, we
          introduced the Connecting You prototype by displaying a real-time availability indicator on an iPad
          positioned beside the living room television, where the elderly will frequently walk past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The status of loved ones was updated manually via a shared Google Sheet, enabling family members to reflect
          their availability in real-time. Throughout the day, we tracked both the number of calls made and the
          number of passive interactions with the iPad (e.g., glances, touches) to gauge the user's level of
          engagement with the display.

          This setup aimed to test whether easy access to live availability information could lower social hesitation
          and increase the likelihood of initiating contact.

        <h4>3.6.1. Befriender at Your Service</h4>
        <p>
          User testing for Befriender at Your Service yielded promising insights into the elderly’s receptiveness to
          AI-mediated conversations. All three participants described the AI as “easy to talk to” and appreciated its
          consistently polite and patient tone. They valued having someone to converse with on their own terms,
          without fear of judgment. Even though they knew the AI was not human, it offered a sense of companionship,
          making them feel “entertained and heard.”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AI has also demonstrated practical utility. In one example, a participant asked where to learn
          pickleball. The AI responded with a list of nearby facilities, and the participant remarked that this was
          helpful because he "would not have known how to search those on the internet." This highlights the AI’s
          potential to bridge digital literacy gaps and provide accessible information in real time.

          <div id="table-befriender-results"></div>
        </table-component>
        <p>
          Quantitative findings (see Table 1) revealed key areas for improvement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interruption vs. Enjoyment: A negative correlation was observed between the number of conversation
            interruptions and user enjoyment (measured by laughter/smiles). Interruptions often occurred when the
            elderly spoke before the AI finished, leading to awkward pauses and inevitably causing the conversation to
            break down. Claude AI had the fewest interruptions due to its push-to-send interface, which reduced
            accidental input from background noise—a common issue with ChatGPT and Gemini, which rely on continuous
            voice detection.</li>
          <li>Misunderstanding vs. Enjoyment: Fewer misunderstandings also corresponded with higher engagement. AIs
            often struggled to interpret local expressions or Singlish, which limited their ability to maintain
            shared context. Participants noted that these moments made them feel “less understood” or “distant” from
            the AI.
          </li>
          <li>Turn-taking Dynamics: Participants reported that the AI sometimes “talked too much,” creating an
            unnatural conversation flow. Long monologues from the AI made them feel like they were waiting for their
            turn, which contradicted typical human conversational patterns where interruptions or overlaps are common.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In contrast, the Connecting You prototype yielded limited impact. As shown in Table 2, the number of calls
          remained the same. However, the participant interacted with the iPad nine times, suggesting passive
          interest in the display.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elderly participant shared that while the status display helped her stay updated on her loved ones’
          busyness, she still hesitated to call due to a lack of conversation topics, saying she “didn’t know what to
          talk about besides asking how they are.” The display thus offered emotional reassurance but failed to
          overcome deeper social hesitation or conversation anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, loved ones found it tedious to update their availability manually via Google Sheets, often
          forgetting to change their status after completing tasks. This friction further limited the real-time
          reliability of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we acknowledge that the small sample size and short duration limit the generalisability of our
          findings for Connecting You.

      <div id="section-3-7-refinement-of-concept">
        <h3>3.7. Refinement of Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Findings from the critical function prototyping suggest that Befriender at Your Service holds strong
          potential in alleviating perceived loneliness among the elderly. Participants appreciated having an
          always-available companion who responded politely and engaged in conversations on their terms. This
          constant, non-judgmental presence offered a sense of comfort, agency, and emotional connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, the Connecting You concept did not increase the frequency of user-initiated calls. While the
          live availability display provided some peace of mind by allowing the elderly to stay updated on their
          loved ones’ busyness, it did not serve as an effective nudge to initiate contact. However, one element of
          the Connecting You concept, AI-curated activity suggestions, was well-received from our test in the
          Befriender at Your Service. Participants appreciated learning about nearby events aligned with their
          interests, given their limited digital literacy, which often prevents them from discovering such
          opportunities on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on these insights, we propose merging the two concepts. We will integrate the proactive, personalised
          event-sharing feature from Connecting You into Befriender at Your Service. The resulting AI companion will
          not only offer conversational support but also serve as a contextual recommender, nudging users towards
          meaningful activities in their community.
        </p>
        <p>
          To further refine this concept, we will investigate several key areas in the following semester:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medium preference: Identify the most suitable hardware interface (e.g., AR glasses, tablet, TV overlay)
            for elderly users. </li>
          <li>Localisation: Develop a culturally relevant AI that understands and responds naturally to Singlish,
            local references, and Singaporean conversational norms. </li>
          <li>Content design: Discover common conversation topics that resonate with elderly users and determine
            preferred formats for sharing programme information. </li>
          <li>Nudging: Assess the effectiveness of using AI to proactively surface interest-aligned programmes and
            determine whether such nudges increase the likelihood of participation in social or community activities.
          </li>

          We will now be exploring the social workers' portion of our two-pronged approach.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-4-1-1-role-of-social-workers">
        <h4>4.1.1. Role of Social Workers </h4>
        <p>
          According to the National Council of Social Services (NCSS), the role of a social worker is complex as they
          juggle many responsibilities, such as working with clients to set goals and develop case plans,
          facilitating access to resources and maintaining and submitting social reports, just to name a few [23].
        </p>
        <p>
          We have broken it down to 3 key client-facing tasks they carry out to provide holistic care to the elderly:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Case work and counselling </li>
          <li>Advocacy and resource linkage </li>
          <li>Community development</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For case work and counselling, they are required to provide end-to-end case management and support and an
          appropriate level of care through assessment, care planning and interventions. This step is further broken
          down [24], with key points such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Establish rapport and build professional relationships </li>
          <li>Identify issues related to the problem and gather relevant information from clients, and conduct needs
            and intake assessment </li>
          <li>Provide recommendations to modify case plans </li>
          <li>Document and maintain case files and prepare reports </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For advocacy and resource linkage, they act as middlemen to facilitate the flow of resources from other
          agencies and tap on community resources to provide intervention support for the clients. Social workers act
          on behalf of their clients in order to access needed resources, services or to influence policy change,
          which includes filing case reports. They have to liaise with agencies and make service referrals [25].
        </p>
        <p>
          For community development, social workers are required to design, develop and implement community-specific
          development programmes after assessing the needs, while also participating in community development
          initiatives. They have to track outcomes from these initiatives and collect data as well.

          The scope of their job is incredibly wide, notwithstanding the fact that they usually handle dozens of
          cases simultaneously. An article published by CNA cites multiple social workers who are incredibly burnt
          out due to the workload. [26] For example, a crisis by one of the clients may require bringing 3 children
          to the hospital at 4 am, only for their workday to begin in 5 hours. It would be understandable that an
          industry veteran would be exhausted when pushed to their limits after several years. The article also talks
          about the excessive caseload a social worker faces, handling 30 to 50 cases at a given time. They also
          said: “These ‘excessive’ caseloads ‘directly hurt their ability to do a good job’, as they have less
          attention to give to each case.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Each client also comes with their various admin tasks, as mentioned in the section on case work above.
          Social workers are also required to maintain these case files, often having to transcribe meetings with
          clients, which are incredibly time-consuming and tedious, on top of excessive paperwork. [26] Coupled with
          the massive number of clients they are required to handle, social workers are often overwhelmed by admin
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the overwhelming workload due to high case load and tedious admin tasks is often cited as the key
          reason that impedes the ability of social workers to perform their best.

        <h4>4.1.3. Problem Statement for Social Worker</h4>
        <p>
          Every week, social workers supporting the 223 Active Ageing Centres (AACs) in Singapore [27] assist
          numerous different elderly in the neighbourhood with different circumstances and personalities. With so
          many different personal circumstances, it is often difficult for the staff to provide personalised social
          assistance to the elderly. As a result, the need for creating personalised approaches significantly
          increases the complexity of the staff’s job scope, leaving them with less time to support the elderly.

          In this section, we will first explain how we broke down the job map, followed by how we found the desired
          outcomes, and lastly, how we developed concepts to address these desired outcomes of social workers using
          the outcome-driven innovation approach by Anthony Ulwick [28].

        <p>
          Our team mapped out a 12-step job map for social workers doing the job of visiting the elderly. The 5 key
          steps are highlighted in red in the figure above.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the job map, we identified a total of 36 outcomes [Refer to <a href="#appendix-c">Appendix C</a>].
          Outcomes are measures of value that define how social workers want to get the job done and what they need
          to get the job done perfectly [28, p.26].
        </p>
        <p>
          By consulting the social workers, we used the opportunity algorithm of <strong>“Opportunity = Importance +
            max (importance - satisfaction, 0)”</strong> [28, p.45], and shortlisted the <strong>top 4 most
            underserved outcomes</strong> for social workers, highlighted in yellow in the table below.

        </p>
        <p>
          4 key categories were chosen as shown in the table below. The bulk of weightage was allocated to the 4
          underserved outcomes. Reduction of time required to do administrative reports was given a lower weightage
          because it has the lowest opportunity score among all 4 outcomes, as shown in Table 3 above.

          <li><strong>The AI:</strong> The “AI” provides prompts through text messages, while referring to a fact

            to the conversation. </li>
          <li><strong>The “social worker”:</strong> A befriender who role-played as a social worker. He referred to

        <p>
          The key findings are shown in Table 5 above. In particular, we found that 45% of prompts were converted to
          actual topics, and 18% led to enjoyable topics that made the elderly smile. This tells us that prompts can
          help facilitate conversation with the elderly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the “social worker” was able to achieve a talk ratio of 78% elderly, 22% himself, which is
          close to the benchmark of 70% patient and 30% talk ratio for therapists [29].
        </p>

          subtitle="Table 6: Prompts that led to enjoyable conversations"></image-component>
        <p>
          We also discovered that some prompts the elderly enjoy discussing can revolve around lotteries, as well as
          their good old memories. These can be seen in Table 6 above. Refer to <a href="#appendix-e">Appendix E</a>
          for the prompts given.

        </p>
        <p>
          However, the “social worker” did mention that it was difficult to use the prompts in certain situations
          because he could not link the prompt and the current conversation. Refer to <a href="#appendix-f">Appendix

        <p>
          In conclusion, the results are promising and they show us that distraction-free factual prompts can aid the
          “social worker” in generating topics for the conversation, and could even potentially lead to enjoyable
          topics. This directly addresses the respective underserved outcomes.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Increase the number of topics that can be talked about with the elderly so that visits are more
            conversational. </li>

        <h4>4.4.5. Shortcomings of Results</h4>
        <p>
          However, there are some important limitations to note.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Firstly, the sample size tested is too small. We only conducted it on 1 “social worker” and 1 elderly.
            The small sample size cannot represent the experience of the larger population of elderly and social
            workers. </li>
          <li>Secondly, the tester of our CEP is not the same as the user of our product. The users of our product
            are meant to be social workers in the elderly field. </li>
          <li>Lastly, although the elderly and the “social worker” are strangers, they know the observer mutually. As
            a result, the elderly would be less inclined to feel tense because the mutual relationship already helps
            to establish some form of rapport.</li>

        <p>
          To address the downside where the user found it hard to draw connections between the current conversation
          and the fact, we propose combining the Fact Assistant and Real Time Coach concepts to address this. Since
          the Fact Assistant only provides the user with the <strong>what</strong>, the Real Time Coach can
          complement it by providing the <strong>how</strong>, which helps the user to connect the dots.

        <ol>
          <li>Firstly, to validate our results, we would need to increase our sample size. </li>

          subtitle="Figure 5: Two-pronged Approach"></image-component>
        <p>
          In conclusion, our two-pronged approach aims to alleviate the elderly loneliness problem through the
          elderly and the social workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our findings indicate that elderly users are generally receptive to AI companions, particularly when
          interactions are consistent, empathetic, and easy to access. The AI companion shows strong potential to
          address the limitations of current befriending models by offering scalable, on-demand emotional support.
          Thereby alleviating pressure on human volunteers and social infrastructure. A key milestone in the next
          phase of development will be the creation of a culturally attuned "Singaporean AI" to enhance relatability
          and user trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the social workers, we discovered that real time prompts have the potential to boost social worker
          interactions with the elderly. It is especially useful when the prompts are relevant to the hobbies or
          interests of the elderly.
        </D>
        <p>
          Moving forward, more testing and a combination of concepts for both approaches are required to further
          validate our interim findings.
