        <h2> 1. Introduction (Maia) </h2>
        <p>
          The NUS-Stanford Global Engineering Design Innovation Programme is a collaborative effort between the 2
          universities, where project teams, together with an industry partner, work to solve a problem to break down a
          problem statement through extensive research to identify a problem or need based on a broadly defined prompt
          provided by the industry partner. We are also required to generate ideas for solutions and undergo rapid
          prototyping for refinement and improvement. [m9]
        </p>
        <p>
          The prompt assigned to us is as follows: This project explores how smart glasses, sensors, and AI can augment
          and enrich social interactions. Students should consider diverse user groups to uncover unmet needs, then
          propose solutions that address those needs through the design of the user experience and hardware/software
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the extensiveness of the prompt, our Our team ,worked hard to uncover the needs of a myriad of
          underserved groups under the guidance of our professor and advisor, Professor Khoo Eng Tat and Graham Zhu,.
          We were encouraged to first started by exploring many potential user groups. in the beginning., We then
          delvedto delve deeper into a select few groups with the most potential to workexpand on. Initial groups we
          explored included the visually-impaired, hearing-impaired and networking professionals. After weeks of deep
          research and deliberation, we have decided to focus our efforts on the topic of elderly loneliness, an
          increasingly prevalent problem, particularly around the world and in the Singapore context. We have identified
          2 key stakeholders and the obstacles they face: the elderly and social workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          (maia)
          According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), in 2020, the number of people aged 60 and older outnumbered
          those aged 5 and below [m4]. By 2030, one in six people worldwide will be 60 or older. By 2050, the number of
          people aged 60 and older will double. This is all in part due to the declining birth rate and advancements in
          healthcare and ageing interventions, leading to higher life expectancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the huge investments we have placed in geriatric medicine, one aspect we have continuously neglected is
          the mental toll plaguing the elderly. In 2023, the World Health Organisation declared loneliness a global
          public health concern [j1]. Around the world, countries have created task forces to tackle this issue
          specifically [j2]. Japan and the United Kingdom have established a new role called the Minister for
          Loneliness, which highlights the increased focus that these countries are putting on addressing it [j2]. In
          Singapore, about an average of 50% or more people feel socially isolated and coupled with the ageing
          population, it puts a strain on our community to reach out to the elderly and keep them engaged [j3]. The
          truth of the matter is: the silver tsunami is increasingly enveloping our populations and exacerbating this
          problem in the elderly. Around 14.1% of people age 70 and older live with a mental disorder, the most common
          being depression and anxiety, resulting in global deaths by suicide in this group being a staggering 16.6%
          [m6]. It is also well documented that individuals who are socially isolated are at a greater risk of
          developing health conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, and this will have a huge impact on the healthcare
          system and caregivers in the community [j5].
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Puyane et al, they define the difference between social isolation and loneliness as follows:
          social isolation refers to an objective lack of social contact, while loneliness is the subjective experience
          of unmet social needs [m5]. A study [m1] identified key factors contributing to elderly loneliness, such as:
          being old, a widow/divorced, having a lower level of education and/or income, living alone, having a chronic
          disease, poor self-perceived health, lack of visits by relatives or acquaintances, dissatisfaction with the
          place of living, and being fully dependent while performing daily activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          What can be done to combat this? It turns out that having more frequent, more pleasant and in-person social
          interactions, as well as interactions with friends and family specifically, significantly predicted lower
          momentary loneliness a few hours later. [m2] Additionally, home-based interventions were found to
          significantly increase older adults’ social connectedness (social support and social engagement) and reduce
          their loneliness and depressive symptoms; and interventions using mixed platforms were more favourable, which
          include face-to-face and digital delivery. [m3]
        </p>
        <p>
          The sheer volume of the elderly we are faced with urges us to divert our attention and resources to
          investigate advancing healthy ageing, and that is precisely what we aim to uncover. Given the growing
          challenges of the loneliness issueTherefore, this project aims to create a new system using extended reality
          (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to bridge the gap faced by the elderly when building and maintaining
          social interactions.

        </p>

          is the subjective experience of unmet social needs [m5]. A study [m1] identified key factors contributing to

          <u>Active ageing, Befriending, and Care and support in the Community model (ABC)</u>
        </p>
        <image-component tag="fig-1" source="" subtitle="Figure 1: ABC Model"></image-component>
        <p>
          Singapore's strategy to combat social isolation employs the 'ABC' framework, which differentiates its
          approach across a continuum of need: <strong>Active Ageing</strong> functions as the primary <strong>preventive
            strategy</strong> for all older adults, promoting participation in social, cultural, spiritual, and civic
          affairs to maintain overall health and quality of life, thereby stemming the initial onset of isolation [T1].
          In contrast, <strong>Befriending</strong> is a <strong>targeted intervention</strong> focusing on older people
          already identified as socially isolated, creating a "<strong>purpose-built, one-on-one
            relationship</strong>" to provide direct companionship and fill the social gap for those who lack a
          personal network [T2], [T3]. Finally, the <strong>Community</strong> pillar, facilitated by groups such as
          Resident Networks and the People's Association, offers accessible programs, such as fitness classes and arts
          and crafts sessions, that serve as supported group-based environments to foster new social connections and
          encourage active engagement among seniors in their neighbourhood [T4].
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Befriender Model Overview</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          As Singapore's traditional family structures evolve and fewer relatives live together, the societal need for
          companionship services has grown, prompting social service agencies to complement their core programmes with
          befriending [T5], [T7]. This service targets older adults who exhibit at least one of the four risk factors:
          living alone, physical or cognitive impairment, limited social networks, or serving as a primary caregiver.
          These factors reduce the daily social contact and emotional support that the individuals need.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) defines a befriender primarily as a companion who provides
          sustained emotional support and cultivates meaningful social bonds. Through regular home visits and
          conversations, befrienders work to reduce loneliness and encourage seniors to participate in activities
          outside the home [T7].
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Gap in the Current Model</u>
        </p>
        <image-component tag="fig-2" source="" subtitle="Figure 2: Gaps in the Befriending model"></image-component>
        <p>
          Current befriending services face a twofold crisis in logistics and design. Agencies struggle to recruit and
          retain volunteers for long-term commitments because the model requires frequent visits, such as twice weekly
          over six months or longer, and few people can sustain this level of involvement [T8]. Turnover matters
          because isolated seniors need time and a steady presence to build trust, and for many, consistency is not a
          preference but a source of personal security. Knowing that someone will reliably visit or call creates
          perceived dependability, which is important for befriending to be successful [T9].
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these operational challenges, research on the befriending model often shows weak and inconsistent
          long-term effectiveness [T6]. This failure stems from a disconnect between the service's design and what
          seniors actually value [T6].
        </p>
        <p>
          Practitioners report that the loneliest seniors do not want a random visitor; they want a genuine connection
          with peers who share similar backgrounds and life experiences [T5]. Research shows that effective befriending
          does not happen by chance and depends on activating specific mechanisms that current models often ignore
          [T6]. The mechanisms include empathy, reciprocity and autonomy. Shared experience generates empathy, for
          example, when a befriender and a senior both live with arthritis. Shared characteristics foster reciprocity,
          enabling volunteers and users to form mutual two-way relationships. Long-term flexible relationships support
          autonomy, while rigid, predefined priorities do not. To be effective, programmes must therefore prioritise
          deliberate matching and sustained relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the current befriending model fails because it is built on a "buddy" system of random,
          high-turnover volunteers, while the loneliest seniors need consistent, peer-to-peer connections to feel
          secure and understood.

        <p>
          We started our journey by interviewing diverse stakeholders, including academics, social workers, startup
          founders and community organisers from the People’s Association and Active Ageing Centres to gain a deeper
          understanding of social isolation. We also gathered direct user insights from the elderly through a card
          sorting activity.

          With the insights tabulated in <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJAMZw-E=/">Miro</a> , we identified
          categories of needs that could be broadly classified under social interactions, successful interactions,
          autonomy, training and support for workers, cognitive stimulation, and cultural stigma. From these
          categories, we developed broad-level need statements.

              <td>
                <strong>Need for Relatable, Judgment-Free Conversation:</strong> The elderly prioritise relatable conversations and the freedom to talk about their own interests without being "judged or criticised." The enjoyment and relatability of the conversation, even if superficial, are often more important than its depth.<br><br>
                <strong>Need for Consistent, Trust-Based Relationships:</strong> The elderly struggle to build bonds with "transient" volunteers. They need consistent social support, which requires significant time ("relationship banking," "200 hours") to build trust. This is why "friends may be stronger social support than family," as family may be too tired or busy.<br><br>
                <strong>Need for Validation & Agency:</strong> They require "attention/reciprocation" and a sense of control. A "loss of sense of control" or threats to their "ego" can cause disengagement.<br><br>
                <strong>Need for Diverse & Context-Rich Activities:</strong> The elderly feel “left out" due to a "lack of diversity" in social activities, which become monotonous. They need activities curated around shared context (e.g., "Places, Pets, Plants") to foster easier, more natural interactions.

              <td>
                <strong>Need for streamlined administrative and cognitive support:</strong> Social workers are caught in a conflict between administrative duties like following documentation formats, remembering details for "80 over patients", while also being present with the client. This is worsened by organisational pressure not to write things down during a visit, placing a heavy cognitive load on them to document everything later. This pressure, combined with KPIs, can make interactions feel "robotic" and create friction with the elderly.<br><br>
                <strong>Need for realistic, experiential training:</strong> There is a significant gap between theoretical university education and the practical, high-stress reality of social work. Students and new social workers "know what needs to be done but tend to overthink," often freezing because they lack the hands-on experience to "handle a variety of situations" or manage their "fears." Current AI chatbot training tools are inadequate because they lack real-time verbal interaction and personalisation, failing to mimic the "normal flow" of an unpredictable human conversation.<br><br>
                <strong>Need for in-the-moment decision support:</strong> Beyond just training, social workers need real-time help during stressful encounters. They need "prompts" that can help them regulate their own emotions and the elderly's emotions, allowing them to remain "grounded" and "confident" when "unexpected things occur," rather than feeling "shocked."<br><br>
                <strong>Need for scalable manpower solutions:</strong> There is a persistent "manpower shortage" of both professional social workers (due to staffing ratios) and volunteer befrienders. This scarcity will only get worse as the number of isolated seniors increases, amplifying the pressure on the existing workforce and making it impossible to rely on traditional, time-intensive engagement models alone.

                <strong>Need for technology-assisted autonomy:</strong> There is a clear opportunity for technology to act as a "provocateur" that helps seniors independently manage their Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) and make supported decisions.

              <td>
                <strong>Need to bridge intergenerational and cultural communication gaps:</strong> Younger generations and social workers struggle to connect due to differing communication styles (e.g., "western culture" vs. local norms) and generational differences, which can lead to misunderstandings and a reluctance for the elderly to open up.<br><br>
                <strong>Need to overcome the stigma associated with seeking formal support:</strong> Societal norms create a significant barrier, making many seniors reluctant to seek mental health support or engage with social services, as they associate it with a loss of autonomy or social stigma.<br><br>
                <strong>Need for non-traditional engagement models that build shared context:</strong> Standard programs fail to attract "untapped seniors" and "male elderly." There is a need for alternative approaches, like fostering a "Kampong Spirit" or using a "shared AI," that create a natural, shared context (like "current affairs" or a shared "pet") to encourage interaction.

        <image-component tag="fig-xx" source="" subtitle="Figure xx: Two-pronged approach"></image-component>
        <p>
          Drawing on our primary and secondary research, we adopt a two-pronged approach to address elderly loneliness.
          First, we support older adults in leading more connected lives through technology and human networks. Given
          persistent manpower shortages, the current befriender model cannot reliably deliver sustained companionship;
          technology can complement it and reduce reliance on volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we empower social workers to deliver more timely, personalised support. Heavy caseloads and
          administrative burden constrain service quality. Hence, by streamlining workflows and providing decision
          support, social workers can devote more time to high-value interactions that help seniors reconnect with the
          community and live with dignity.

        <h2>3. Supporting the Elderly (Jonathan)</h2>
        <p>
          In this section, we will explore the concepts related to the elderly (above age 65) that can address the gaps
          identified in the previous section.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-3-1-problem-statement-for-the-elderly">
        <h3>3.1. Problem Statement for the Elderly</h3>
        <p>
          Socially isolated elderly in Singapore need reliable, long-term companionship to reduce loneliness and
          preserve their overall well-being. Existing befriending models fail to deliver sustained, well-matched
          relationships due to volunteer shortages and the short-term matching of random volunteers who do not meet the
          needs of the elderly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-3-2-user-needs">
        <h3>3.2. User Needs</h3>
        <p>
          To address the problem statement, the solution must address the following elderly needs:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Elderly users need a non-judgmental space where they can express views and emotions without criticism or
            stigma. </li>
          <li>Elderly users need companionship access that is consistently available when they reach out. </li>
          <li>Elderly users need an interaction channel that is accessible and intuitive for low digital-literacy users
            and those with sensory or motor limitations.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div id="section-3-3-case-studies-on-ai-companions">
        <h3>3.3. Case studies on AI Companions</h3>
        <p>
          A two-week ChatGPT intervention with 20 older adults reduced the proportion scoring above the UCLA loneliness
          threshold of 43, a high degree of loneliness, from 100% to 32%. Participants attributed this change to the
          system’s constant availability and perceived dependability, noting that <strong>“ChatGPT is always there to
            chat with me, no matter the time or day.”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          They valued the AI’s ability to hold context-rich conversations across social, recreational and informational
          topics, saying <strong>“I liked that ChatGPT could talk about a lot of different things, from the weather to
            my favourite TV shows,”</strong> and they described most interactions as social, recreational, educational
          or emotional in nature [10].
        </p>
        <p>
          Users also highlighted practical benefits, including instant information retrieval, calendar management and
          medication reminders, and they said the AI’s patient, non-judgmental responses encouraged disclosure and
          emotional sharing. Several participants called the system a confidant, reporting that <strong>“it understands
            me in ways that no one else can,”</strong> and many summed up the experience with, <strong>“It’s comforting
            to know that there is someone who listens and understands, even if it’s an AI.”</strong> Together, these
          findings show that consistent availability, empathetic tone, contextual knowledge and being an easy
          information source combine to produce meaningful companionship and measurable reductions in loneliness [10].
        </p>
        <p>
          A six-month pilot of an Alexa AI assistant with 105 homebound older adults produced a mean reduction of 10.87
          points on the UCLA Loneliness Scale, offering a real-world benchmark for medium-term impact [11]. The device
          functioned as a companion, facilitating communication with family and friends and providing practical
          support such as medication and appointment reminders, suggesting that conversational presence combined with
          task assistance can improve both social connectedness and day-to-day functioning [11].
        </p>
        <p>
          With the research being positive on the use of chatbots to alleviate the perception of loneliness the next
          promising direction include prioritising low-friction delivery, such as TV and natural speech or gesture
          interfaces to maximise uptake, leveraging AI’s always-on availability to provide consistent perceived
          dependability that builds trust, and using proactive but tunable nudges to increase engagement while
          monitoring intrusion [T13],[T15].
        </p>
        <p>
          This gap creates a clear design space for alternative solutions that reliably deliver consistent,
          judgment-free social contact that the elderly can relate to, which could potentially nudge them to carry out
          activities that reduce social isolation.

        <h3>3.4. Development of Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          From the previous section, conversational AI can help alleviate loneliness among older adults. When paired
          with the hands-free interface of AR glasses, this approach can significantly reduce the friction in user
          interaction. Building on this idea, we propose two concepts designed to address the companionship gap faced
          by socially isolated elderly individuals.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="fig-5" source=""
          subtitle="Figure 5: A visual illustration of Befriender at Your Service (Generated using Gemini)"></image-component>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Befriender at Your Service:</strong> This concept envisions AR glasses equipped with a familiar
            avatar and a conversational AI tailored to the needs of older adults. The system sustains companionship by
            proactively initiating check-ins, recalling past conversations and personal preferences. The AI will employ
            non-judgmental, validation-oriented language to ensure users feel heard and respected. Its always-on
            availability and predictable interaction cadence offer a stable alternative to volunteer befrienders,
            helping mitigate the inconsistencies of current models. The interface prioritises accessibility through
            hands-free, low-friction controls, making it suitable for users with limited technological familiarity or
            physical impairments. </li>
        </ol>
        <image-component tag="fig-6" source=""
          subtitle="Figure 6: A visual illustration of Connecting You (Generated using Gemini)"></image-component>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong>Connecting You:</strong> This concept features an AR heads-up display that highlights a curated
            list of close contacts, alongside real-time availability indicators. Users can initiate a voice or video
            call with a single spoken command, reducing the uncertainty and hesitation associated with interrupting
            others. By removing technical barriers, such as navigating apps or contact lists, the system streamlines
            the connection process. Additionally, the interface will show nearby social activities aligned with the
            user’s interests, along with one-command RSVP and navigation functions. This reduces cognitive load and
            bridges the gap between event discovery and participation, promoting more frequent and meaningful social
            engagement.</li>

        <h3>3.5. Critical Function Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          To evaluate the effectiveness of our concepts, we conducted critical function prototyping for both ideas. For
          Befriender at Your Service, we tested whether a conversational AI could sustain natural and engaging
          dialogue with elderly users. For Connecting You, we assessed whether real-time visibility of loved ones’
          availability would encourage more frequent user-initiated contact.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-3-5-1-befriender-at-your-service">
        <h4>3.5.1. Befriender at Your Service</h4>
        <image-component tag="fig-7" source="" subtitle="Figure 7: Testing of AI Companion with an Elderly"></image-component>
        <p>
          We tested three conversational AI models—ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—with elderly participants using an iPad
          interface. Each session lasted 1 hour, with each model being tested for 20 minutes, during which we recorded
          the following metrics:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Number of conversation interruptions/drop-offs </li>
          <li>Number of misunderstandings by AI/user during the conversation </li>
          <li>Ratio of AI-to-user speaking time </li>
          <li>Number of times the user laughed/smiled (used as a proxy for engagement and enjoyment)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To ensure consistency of the experiment, we prompted the AI based on what makes a good befriender [T16]: “You
          are a compassionate befriender speaking with an older adult in Singapore. Listen, validate, and keep the
          conversation going. Speak at a moderate pace. Use simple, open-ended questions and let the person finish
          before you respond. Be empathetic and match their pace and vocabulary. Ask gentle follow-up questions that
          invite storytelling, and encourage softly if they hesitate. Avoid judging, lecturing, or arguing. If they
          mention harm, severe distress, or a medical emergency, escalate to a human contact. Keep replies brief and
          wait for their response.”.

      </div>

      <div id="section-3-5-2-connecting-you">
        <h4>3.5.2. Connecting You</h4>
        <p>
          To evaluate the effectiveness of displaying loved ones’ availability, we conducted a two-day experiment with
          an elderly participant. On Day 1, we recorded the baseline number of calls made. On Day 2, we introduced the
          Connecting You prototype by displaying a real-time availability indicator on an iPad positioned beside the
          living room television, where the elderly will frequently walk past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The status of loved ones was updated manually via a shared Google Sheet, enabling family members to reflect
          their availability in real-time. Throughout the day, we tracked both the number of calls made and the number
          of passive interactions with the iPad (e.g., glances, touches) to gauge the user's level of engagement with
          the display.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="fig-8" source="" subtitle="Figure 8: Display of the Real-time Availability Indicator"></image-component>
        <p>
          This setup aimed to test whether easy access to live availability information could lower social hesitation
          and increase the likelihood of initiating contact.

        <h4>3.6.1. Befriender at Your Service</h4>
        <p>
          User testing for Befriender at Your Service yielded promising insights into the elderly’s receptiveness to
          AI-mediated conversations. All three participants described the AI as “easy to talk to” and appreciated its
          consistently polite and patient tone. They valued having someone to converse with on their own terms, without
          fear of judgment. Even though they knew the AI was not human, it offered a sense of companionship, making
          them feel “entertained and heard.”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AI has also demonstrated practical utility. In one example, a participant asked where to learn
          pickleball. The AI responded with a list of nearby facilities, and the participant remarked that this was
          helpful because he "would not have known how to search those on the internet." This highlights the AI’s
          potential to bridge digital literacy gaps and provide accessible information in real time.

        <p>
          Quantitative findings (see Table 1) revealed key areas for improvement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interruption vs. Enjoyment: A negative correlation was observed between the number of conversation
            interruptions and user enjoyment (measured by laughter/smiles). Interruptions often occurred when the
            elderly spoke before the AI finished, leading to awkward pauses and inevitably causing the conversation to
            break down. Claude AI had the fewest interruptions due to its push-to-send interface, which reduced
            accidental input from background noise—a common issue with ChatGPT and Gemini, which rely on continuous
            voice detection.</li>
          <li>Misunderstanding vs. Enjoyment: Fewer misunderstandings also corresponded with higher engagement. AIs
            often struggled to interpret local expressions or Singlish, which limited their ability to maintain shared
            context. Participants noted that these moments made them feel “less understood” or “distant” from the AI.
          </li>
          <li>Turn-taking Dynamics: Participants reported that the AI sometimes “talked too much,” creating an
            unnatural conversation flow. Long monologues from the AI made them feel like they were waiting for their
            turn, which contradicted typical human conversational patterns where interruptions or overlaps are common.
          </li>

        <p>
          In contrast, the Connecting You prototype yielded limited impact. As shown in Table 2, the number of calls
          remained the same. However, the participant interacted with the iPad nine times, suggesting passive interest
          in the display.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elderly participant shared that while the status display helped her stay updated on her loved ones’
          busyness, she still hesitated to call due to a lack of conversation topics, saying she “didn’t know what to
          talk about besides asking how they are.” The display thus offered emotional reassurance but failed to
          overcome deeper social hesitation or conversation anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, loved ones found it tedious to update their availability manually via Google Sheets, often
          forgetting to change their status after completing tasks. This friction further limited the real-time
          reliability of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we acknowledge that the small sample size and short duration limit the generalisability of our
          findings for Connecting You.

      <div id="section-3-7-refinement-of-concept">
        <h3>3.7. Refinement of Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Findings from the critical function prototyping suggest that Befriender at Your Service holds strong
          potential in alleviating perceived loneliness among the elderly. Participants appreciated having an
          always-available companion who responded politely and engaged in conversations on their terms. This constant,
          non-judgmental presence offered a sense of comfort, agency, and emotional connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, the Connecting You concept did not increase the frequency of user-initiated calls. While the
          live availability display provided some peace of mind by allowing the elderly to stay updated on their loved
          ones’ busyness, it did not serve as an effective nudge to initiate contact. However, one element of the
          Connecting You concept, AI-curated activity suggestions, was well-received from our test in the Befriender
          at Your Service. Participants appreciated learning about nearby events aligned with their interests, given
          their limited digital literacy, which often prevents them from discovering such opportunities on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on these insights, we propose merging the two concepts. We will integrate the proactive, personalised
          event-sharing feature from Connecting You into Befriender at Your Service. The resulting AI companion will
          not only offer conversational support but also serve as a contextual recommender, nudging users towards
          meaningful activities in their community.
        </p>
        <p>
          To further refine this concept, we will investigate several key areas in the following semester:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medium preference: Identify the most suitable hardware interface (e.g., AR glasses, tablet, TV overlay)
            for elderly users. </li>
          <li>Localisation: Develop a culturally relevant AI that understands and responds naturally to Singlish, local
            references, and Singaporean conversational norms. </li>
          <li>Content design: Discover common conversation topics that resonate with elderly users and determine
            preferred formats for sharing programme information.</li>

        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section-4-1-1-role-of-social-workers">
        <h4>4.1.1. Role of Social Workers </h4>
        <p>
          According to the National Council of Social Services (NCSS), the role of a social worker is complex as they
          juggle many responsibilities, such as working with clients to set goals and develop case plans, facilitating
          access to resources and maintaining and submitting social reports, just to name a few. [m7]
        </p>
        <p>
          We have broken it down to 3 key client-facing tasks they carry out to provide holistic care to the elderly:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Case work and counselling 
            <ol>
              <li>Engagement and assessment </li>
              <li>Case review and documentation </li>
              <li>Goal setting and intervention plans </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Advocacy and resource linkage </li>
          <li>Community development</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For case work and counselling, they are required to provide end-to-end case management and support and an
          appropriate level of care through assessment, care planning and interventions. This step is further broken
          down [m10], with key points such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Establish rapport and build professional relationships </li>
          <li>Identify issues related to the problem and gather relevant information from clients, and conduct needs
            and intake assessment </li>
          <li>Provide recommendations to modify case plans </li>
          <li>Document and maintain case files and prepare reports </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For advocacy and resource linkage, they act as middlemen to facilitate the flow of resources from other
          agencies and tap on community resources to provide intervention support for the clients. Social workers act
          on behalf of their clients in order to access needed resources, services or to influence policy change, which
          includes filing case reports, to seek consideration for the circumstances of a client or to provide
          affirmative action for the client, while including them in the process so they feel empowered and assertive.
          They have to liaise with agencies and make service referrals. [m11]
        </p>
        <p>
          For community development, social workers are required to design, develop and implement community-specific
          development programmes after assessing the needs, while also participating in community development
          initiatives. They have to track outcomes from these initiatives and collect data as well.

      <div id="section-4-1-2-current-gaps-faced">
        <h4>4.1.2. Current gaps faced by social workers</h4>
        <p>
          It is apparent that tThe scope of their job is incredibly wide, notwithstanding the fact that they usually
          handle dozens of cases simultaneously. An article published by CNA cites multiple social workers who are
          incredibly burnt out due to the workload. [m8] For example, a crisis by one of the clients may require
          bringing 3 children to the hospital at 4 am, only for their workday to begin in 5 hours. It would be
          understandable that an industry veteran would be exhausted when pushed to their limits after several years.
          The article also talks about the excessive caseload a social worker faces, handling 30 to 50 cases at a given
          time. They also said: “These ‘excessive’ caseloads ‘directly hurt their ability to do a good job’, as they
          have less attention to give to each case.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Each client also comes with their various admin tasks, as mentioned in the section on case work above. Social
          workers are also required to maintain these case files, often having to transcribe meetings with clients,
          which are incredibly time-consuming and tedious, on top of excessive paperwork. [m8] Coupled with the massive
          number of clients they are required to handle, social workers are often overwhelmed by admin tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the overwhelming workload due to high case load and tedious admin tasks are often cited as the key
          reasons that impede the ability of social workers to perform their best.

        <p>
          Every week, social workers supporting the 223 Active Ageing Centres (AACs) in Singapore [R1] assist numerous
          different elderly in the neighbourhood with different circumstances and personalities. With so many different
          personal circumstances, it is often difficult for the staff to provide personalised social assistance to the
          elderly. As a result, the need for creating personalised approaches significantly increases the complexity of
          the staff’s job scope, leaving them with less time to support the elderly.

          Our team mapped out a 12-step job map for social workers doing the job of visiting the elderly. The 5 key
          steps are highlighted in red in the figure above.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the job map, we identified a total of 36 outcomes. Outcomes are measures of value that define how Social

          The key findings are shown in Table 5 above. In particular, we found that 45% of prompts were converted to
          actual topics, and 18% led to enjoyable topics that made the elderly smile. This tells us that prompts can
          help facilitate conversation with the elderly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the “Social Worker” was able to achieve a talk ratio of 78% elderly, 22% himself, which is
          close to the benchmark of 70% patient and 30% talk ratio for therapists. [R3]

        <p>
          In general, both the “Social Worker” and the elderly found the conversation smooth.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the “Social Worker” did mention that it was difficult to use the prompts in certain situations
          because he could not link the prompt and the current conversation. The questionnaire results can be found in

        <h4>4.4.4. Conclusion of results</h4>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the results are promising and they show us that distraction-free factual prompts can aid the
          “Social Worker” in generating topics for the conversation, and could even potentially lead to enjoyable
          topics. This directly addresses the respective underserved outcomes.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Increase the number of topics that can be talked about with the elderly so that visits are more
            conversational. </li>
          <li>Increase the confidence of the social worker when dealing with the elderly</li>
        </ol>

      <div id="section-4-4-5-shortcomings-of-results">
        <h4>4.4.5. Shortcomings of results</h4>
        <p>
          However, there are some important limitations to note.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Firstly, the sample size tested is too small. We only conducted it on 1 “Social Worker” and 1 elderly.
            The small sample size cannot represent the experience of the larger population of elderly and social
            workers. </li>
          <li>Secondly, the tester of our CEP is not the same as the user of our product. The user of our product is
            meant to be Social Workers in the elderly field. </li>
          <li>Lastly, although the elderly and the “Social Worker” are strangers, they know the observer mutually. As a
            result, the elderly would be less inclined to feel tense because the mutual relationship already helps to
            establish some form of rapport.</li>

        <p>
          To address the downside where the user found it hard to draw connections between the current conversation and
          the fact, we propose combining the Fact Assistant and Real Time Coach concepts to address this. Since the
          Fact Assistant only provides the user with the <strong>what</strong>, the Real Time Coach can complement it by
          providing the <strong>how</strong>, which helps the user to connect the dots.

          following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Firstly, to validate our results, we would need to increase our sample size. </li>
          <li>Secondly, we should now test the Fact Assistant concept on actual Social Workers. This would give us a
            more accurate representation. </li>
          <li>Lastly, to reduce the biasness of our tests, it would be important to test them on strangers.</li>

        <image-component tag="fig-13" source="" subtitle="Figure 13: Two Pronged approach"></image-component>
        <p>
          In conclusion, our two pronged approach aims to alleviate the elderly loneliness problem through the elderly
          and the Social Workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, we discovered that the elderly are receptive towards AI companions. We also discovered that real
          time prompts have the potential to boost Social Worker interactions with elderly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving forward, more testing and combination of concepts for both approaches are required to further
          validate our interim findings.

          After diving deeper into the concepts of each user group to tackle the central problem of elderly loneliness
          social isolation, our next step is to work on addressing the shortfalls of our two pronged approach.
          mentioned in section 4.1.5. and section 4.2.7.. We will consolidate our findings and align our direction with
          the Stanford team to develop a solution that addresses a critical need.

                  Broke the ice well with conversations usually surrounding how the day went for the user , how was
                  work , and usually got the attention of the new user straight away. Seemed like ice breaking was not
                  too much of an issue</td>
                <td><strong>Topical fixation:</strong> The AI repeatedly returned to a single topic — work and jobs — up
                  to seven times, causing the conversation to become monotonous and disengaging.
                  <strong>Turn-taking and pacing:</strong> Frequent pauses, overlaps, and interruptions made the
                  exchange choppy. The AI often spoke over the user, disrupting the participant’s train of thought.
                  <strong>Initiative:</strong> The model rarely initiated or sustained new conversational threads. The
                  participant had to “wait to start talking,” creating an unnatural rhythm where the user carried the
                  flow.
                  <strong>Engagement:</strong> Missed emotional cues such as humour and enthusiasm. For example, when
                  the participant cheerfully shared about his marathon experiences, the AI responded with a generic
                  “tell me more,” failing to build on his excitement. </td>

                <td>The participant responded better when context was added by relatives(e.g., favourite foods or
                  travel topics). With that context, the AI could maintain a smoother flow and was able to engage the
                  user well. When relatable topics were brought up the user even was seen to be visibly excited to
                  explore more into his/ her interests. </td>
                <td><strong>Question-driven style:</strong> The AI relied heavily on direct questioning, rarely
                  initiating new threads independently. The conversation felt one-way, with repetitive prompts rather
                  than co-created dialogue.
                  <strong>Dependence on human context:</strong> The model struggled to infer personal preferences
                  without external input. It required Jonathan to guide the conversation by providing relevant context.
                  <strong>Bad personalisation:</strong> Questions such as “Any plans to relax?” lacked connection to
                  previous responses. When it attempted personalization (e.g., suggesting Bangkok markets or trips), the
                  phrasing sounded scripted and overly formal — “like talking to Wikipedia.” </td>

                <td><strong>Empathy and sensitivity:</strong> Demonstrated empathetic pivots (e.g., “That must have been
                  hard”) and responded compassionately to tough upbringing which got the elderly to nod and acknowledge
                  <strong>Contextual memory:</strong> Remembered earlier conversation details and referenced them
                  later, helping the participant feel “heard” and understood. This continuity enhanced emotional
                  connection.</td>
                <td><strong>Emotional fatigue:</strong> Although the AI was empathetic, it overused deep reflective
                  prompts. After about ten exchanges, the participant showed subtle frustration and shorter replies,
                  indicating cognitive or emotional fatigue.
                  <strong>Topic fixation:</strong> Stayed too long in one reflective mode — reminiscence and family
                  stories — without balancing with lighter or forward-looking topics.
                  <strong>Limited topic rotation:</strong> When the participant shifted to practical, everyday talk,
                  Claude remained empathetic but failed to vary tone or direction. </td>
